# Lucy Sanders Portfolio

Hi, my name is Lucy. I am a fullstack developer with a passion for solving problems creatively.

I recently graduated from the Fullstack Flex Web Development program at Thinkful. 
I love using JS frameworks and implementing libraries to create clean, well-written code. 
Uniting a speedy backend with a beautiful frontend is my happy place!
